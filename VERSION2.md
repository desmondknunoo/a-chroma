# A-Chroma Version 2 Roadmap

These are the "wow factor" additions planned for the next major release to make the app feel premium.

## 1. The "Harmony" Slider
A slider that adjusts the entire palette at once. Slide it toward "Chaos" to diversify the hues, or toward "Harmony" to make them more monochromatic or analogous.

## 2. Environmental Lighting Simulator
Let users see how their palette looks under different "screens" (e.g., a phone with low brightness, a monitor with a blue-light filter, or "Dark Mode" vs "Light Mode").

## 3. Collaborative "Party" Rooms
A real-time cursor environment where a team can hit the spacebar together, vote on colors, and chat while building a brand kit.

## 4. Colour Gradient & Mesh Generator
Since solid colors are rarely used alone, allow users to turn their palette into a CSS Linear Gradient or a trendy "Mesh Gradient" with one click.

## 5. Global Trend Heatmap
A public feed showing which color pairings are currently trending globally, allowing users to "surf" the current design aesthetic.

### A Quick Tech Tip
If you are building this as a web app, you'll likely want to use a library like **Colord** or **Chroma.js**. They handle the heavy lifting for color space conversions (like moving from HEX to LCH, which is much better for UI design).
